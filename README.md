# automate-crud

framework in .NET 

I have created custom framework similar to entity framework

This framework will automate code for insert/update/delete/read and various other operations.
- you just have to create enitity/model class 
- create object of my BaseEntity and pass your entity/model 
- that BaseEntity will provide various method for different database operations
